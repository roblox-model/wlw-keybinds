# Wicked Law's Witch

# Attacks:

## E, R, T, Y - Melee, doesn't really do anything besides normal damage.

## H - Absorber

* Creates a fluctuating orb above WLW, absorbing the life force of any human nearby and inflicting low damage per interval. It has 4 levels, starting from when it is first used. Pressing the key again while the orb is still active will enhance it to the next level, which now deals percentage damage per interval. Next level after that will directly set the humanoid's health to zero, and the final level forcibly sets the humanoid's state to Dead.

## Q - Wicked Spark

* WLW fires a red and black beam that repeatedly destroys (as in :Destroy) everything it hits.

## G (Hold) - Stasis

* WLW sends out ripples in spacetime above Her head in an attempt to stabilize reality by erasing all Forbidden Techniques. It only breaks the joints of every entity nearby that is not parented to a Speaker, as a side effect. However, an entity that is parented to one will be punished by this attack. Pressing Space while holding G will change its attack mode. It has three attack modes differentiated by color: Black and White, Red and Black, and Pure Black. Each method has a different way of dealing with Speaker-parented entities, the Black color being the strongest mode.


# Special Attacks

## 1 - ?hésiter

* WLW utilizes Chaos Magic and conjures a dark ray from above to strike down an area in front of it, everything hit by the attack will get voided. The voiding effect lasts until you are unvanished (only targets the parts that were caught and does not decimate).

## 2 - ?inconnu

* WLW summons an infinitely collapsing orb that can be controlled by WLW through the mouse, eventually the orb implodes and explodes, and everyone hit by the explosion is hit with a mesh derendering attack. Also lasts until you are unvanished (does not decimate).

## 3 - ?rideau

* WLW summons an imaginary point in space a few studs above Her character that infinitely emits an unknown type of energy for a certain amount of time. The attack can be sent to where the mouse is pointed like a Spirit Bomb, the attack slowly approaching its target. All entities hit by the attack will get frame derendered. Lasts until you are unvanished (does not decimate).

## 4 - ?mémoire

* WLW utilizes the Cross and rips apart spacetime into a massive explosion made out of the curse that had made the Witch who it is now. Similar to the first special attack, it uses void methods. The difference is that it uses an insanely fast method of void. Also lasts until you are unvanished (does not decimate).

## 5 - ?Amnéhilesie

* **WLW's ultimate attack (decimate enabled)**. WLW combines Chaos Magic and the Cross to corrupt spacetime in the region. The Cross and the spell circles eventually all turn red and collapse into a single point in space. Afterwards, it opens a Rift made out of pure evil and chaos, and seals all entities into an unknown dimension. The attack uses an unknown new method that currently seems to surpass all other killing methods. As of the making of this page, as long as your script's antideath is purely serversided along with animations, and is made out of BaseParts, and does not use any fake rendering methods like HandleAdornments or the like, it is HIGHLY LIKELY that script will die until it is unbanished. There have even been cases of the attack erroring certain scripts. The only attack currently stronger than this attack right now is Infinite Soulabyss's Layer 8.


# Antideath

## Level 1

* Level 1 is the default antideath level, and is easily killed by about 30% of serversided scripts. 

## Level 2

* Level 2 can only be killed by about a handful and a few more scripts. 

## Level 3

* Level 3 can only be killed by only a handful of scripts, although this level is VERY laggy. 

## Level 4

* Level 4 is WLW's strongest antideath mode. One known script is able to kill it.
